multiple page in single-page application



React-Router

Data-fetching & Submission



what is routing

+ different URL path loads different UI 
  + traditioanlly,  a URL corresponds to a html file => multiple-page application
    + when URL change, need re-request html file, bad performance
+ so to build more complex webpage, we use single-page application
  + only one initial html request & response
  + URL (page) changes are handled by client-side (React) code => chages the visible content without fetching  a new HTML file
