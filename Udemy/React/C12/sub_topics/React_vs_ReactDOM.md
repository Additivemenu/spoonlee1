## React vs. ReactDOM

React and ReactDOM are both libraries developed by Facebook, but they serve different purposes within the ecosystem of a React application. Here's an overview of their relationship:

1. **React (Core Library)**:
    - **Purpose**: It is the core library responsible for defining and handling components, the main building blocks of a React application.
    - **Concepts**: Introduces the concept of a component, state, props, lifecycle methods, hooks, and context.
    - **Platform Agnostic**: React's design aims to be platform-agnostic. This means you can theoretically use React with any view-rendering platform, not just the web. There's React Native (for mobile app development), React VR (for virtual reality apps), and more. This core library doesn't concern itself with how the components are rendered to the screen, just how to design and manage them.

2. **ReactDOM**:
    - **Purpose**: It acts as a bridge between the React components and the DOM (Document Object Model) of the browser. Essentially, it renders React components in a web environment.
    - **Methods**: Provides methods like `ReactDOM.render()`, which is used to render a React element into a DOM node, and `ReactDOM.findDOMNode()`, which is less commonly used and can retrieve the underlying DOM node from a component.
    - **Specific to Web**: While React itself is platform-agnostic, ReactDOM is specifically for the web. For other platforms, you'd use different renderers. For example, with React Native, there's a renderer that turns React components into native mobile components.

## Analogy

To give you a basic analogy, consider React as the **<u>blueprint</u>** of a house, while ReactDOM is the **<u>construction crew</u>** that builds the house based on the blueprint, but specifically builds it as a brick house (for the web). If you wanted a wooden house (a mobile app, in this analogy), you'd use another construction crew (React Native).

When setting up a typical React project for web development, you'd use both React (for component logic) and ReactDOM (to render these components to the web page). However, if you were setting up a React Native project, you'd use React along with the React Native library, not ReactDOM.
