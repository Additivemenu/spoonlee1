# Intro

To start, it's helpful to be familiar with three foundational web concepts:

- The [Environments](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering#rendering-environments) your application code can be executed in: the server and the client.
- The [Request-Response Lifecycle](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering#request-response-lifecycle) that's initiated when a user visits or interacts with your application.
- The [Network Boundary](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering#network-boundary) that separates server and client code.

## Using server rendering in Next.js

<span style="color:red">By default, Next.js uses Server Components.</span> 

This allows you to automatically implement server rendering with no additional configuration, and you can opt into using Client Components when needed, see [Client Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).
