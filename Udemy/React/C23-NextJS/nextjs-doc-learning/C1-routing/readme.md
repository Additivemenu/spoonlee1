提到route, 就想到file system 对应的component tree hierarchy, 1个url其实就是对应1条从root layout到达某个page.tsx的tree path 



# Intro



`app` route

+ <span style="color: red">By default, components inside `app` are [React Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components).</span> This is a performance optimization and allows you to easily adopt them, and you can also use [Client Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).



## Folders and files

+ **Folders** are used to define routes. 
  + A route is a single path of nested folders, following the file-system hierarchy from the **root folder** down to a final **leaf folder** that includes a `page.js` file.
+ **Files** are used to create UI that is shown for a route segment.

## file conventions

https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#file-conventions

special files under `app` directory: 

| file name                                                    | Description                                                  |

| [`template`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#templates) | Specialized re-rendered Layout UI                            |
| [`default`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/default) | Fallback UI for [Parallel Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) |



:bangbang: other files under `app` directory are not treated as react components by Next



see colocation: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#colocation

+ while folders define routes, only the contents returned by `page.js` or `route.js` are publicly addressable. 就是说, folder对应route segment, 但是只有具有page.js 或者 route.js的folder对应的route, 才routable 可到达





## component hierarchy

上述folder, files是如何被next.js转化为对应的react component tree的

https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#component-hierarchy





# 1. :full_moon: Pages & Layouts





## 1.1 Pages

A page is UI that is **unique** to a route. You can define pages by exporting a component from a `page.js` file. Use nested folders to [define a route](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and a `page.js` file to make the route publicly accessible.

- A page is always the [leaf](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#terminology) of the [route subtree](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#terminology).
- A `page.js` file is required to make a route segment publicly accessible.
- Pages are [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) by default but can be set to a [Client Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).
- Pages can fetch data. View the [Data Fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching) section for more information.



## 1.2 Layouts

https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#layouts

A layout is UI that is **shared** between multiple pages. 

+ <span style="color:red">On navigation (route changing), layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not re-render.</span> Layouts can also be [nested](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#nesting-layouts).

- Layouts are [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) by default but can be set to a [Client Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).
- Layouts can fetch data. View the [Data Fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching) section for more information.
- A `layout.js` and `page.js` file can be defined in the same folder. The layout will wrap the page.
- Any route segment can optionally define its own [Layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#nesting-layouts). These layouts will be shared across all pages in that segment.

## 1.3 Templates

https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#templates

Templates are similar to layouts in that they wrap each child layout or page. 

Unlike layouts that persist across routes and maintain state, <span style="color:red">templates create a new instance for each of their children on navigation</span>. 

+ This means that when a user navigates between routes that share a template, a new instance of the component is mounted, DOM elements are recreated, state is **not** preserved, and effects are re-synchronized.





## 1.4  loading.tsx & loading state



[Instant Loading States](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#instant-loading-states): An instant loading state is fallback UI that is shown immediately upon navigation. 



### :bangbang: streaming with Suspense



how is SSR working (see more in rendering chapter)

---

With SSR, there's a series of steps that need to be completed before a user can see and interact with a page:

1. First, all data for a given page is fetched on the server.
2. The server then renders the HTML for the page.
3. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the page are sent to the client.
4. A non-interactive user interface is shown using the generated HTML, and CSS.
5. Finally, React [hydrates](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#hydrating-server-rendered-html) the user interface to make it interactive.

<img src="./src_md/SSR1.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

:bangbang: Limitation of SSR: has to wait for the whole page to be rendered 

+ These steps are sequential and blocking, meaning the server can only render the HTML for a page once all the data has been fetched. And, on the client, React can only hydrate the UI once the code for all components in the page has been downloaded.



streaming

---

:white_check_mark: => streaming: allows you to break down the page's HTML into smaller chunks and progressively send those chunks from the server to the client.

<img src="./src_md/streaming1.png" style="zoom:50%;" />



:gem: [Example use case of suspense](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#example)

```ts
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import { PostFeed, Weather } from './Components'
 
export default function Posts() {
  return (
    <section>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading feed...</p>}>
        <PostFeed />
      </Suspense>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading weather...</p>}>
        <Weather />
      </Suspense>
    </section>
  )
}
```

## 1.5  error.tsx & error state

https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling



:bangbang: error.tsx has to be client component!





Error.tsx compoent has 2 props

+ error: error received from server component. [How `error.js` Works](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling#how-errorjs-works)
  + If an error is thrown inside a Server Component, Next.js will forward an `Error` object (stripped of sensitive error information in production) to the nearest `error.js` file as the `error` prop.
+ reset: used to [Recovering From Errors](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling#recovering-from-errors)





### :bangbang: error handling scope



[Nested Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling#nested-routes) : 

React components created through [special files](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#file-conventions) are rendered in a [specific nested hierarchy](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#component-hierarchy).

<img src="./src_md/nested-route1.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

+ error.tsx will handle all errors for its nested child segments
+ but will not handle errors thrown in a layout.tsx or template.tsx in the same route segment as the error boundary is nested **inside** that layout's component.
  + => so how to handle errors thrown by layout or template?

# 2. Linking & navigation

https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating

2 ways to do navigation in Next.js

+ `<Link>` (primary use)
+ `useRouter` hook





## 2.1 Link

`<Link>` is a built-in component that extends the HTML `<a>` tag to provide [prefetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#1-prefetching) and client-side navigation between routes. 

+ 和react router就很类似了



[use cases of Next.js <Link>](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#examples)

+ linkingt to dynamic route
+ checking active Link 
+ Scrolling to an id 





## 2.2 useRouter hook

The `useRouter` ([api reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router)) hook allows you to <u>programmatically</u> change routes.

<span style="color: red">This hook can only be used inside Client Components</span> and is imported from `next/navigation`.



**Recommendation:** Use the `<Link>` component to navigate between routes unless you have a specific requirement for using `useRouter`.







## 2.3:question: Dive deeper into navigation

https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#how-routing-and-navigation-works

有点高级, 看不完全懂, 主要是说Next如何对route & navigation做出性能上的优化

后面看多了再回看这个







# 3. Advanced routing concepts

这些concepts最好边做一些项目边体会



## 3.1 Route groups (foldername)

https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups

<span style="color:yellow">一句话总结: 定义不影响route path tree的folder</span>



In the `app` directory, nested folders are normally mapped to URL paths. However, you can mark a folder as a **Route Group** to prevent the folder from being included in the route's URL path.

This allows you to organize your route segments and project files into logical groups without affecting the URL path structure.

A route group can be created by wrapping a folder's name in parenthesis: `(folderName)`



:gem: [Examples use cases](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups#examples)







## 3.2 Dynamic route [foldername]

https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes

<span style="color:yellow">一句话总结: 往route path里加参数</span>



When you don't know the exact segment names ahead of time and want to create routes from dynamic data, you can use Dynamic Segments that are filled in at request time or [prerendered](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#generating-static-params) at build time.

A Dynamic Segment can be created by wrapping a folder's name in square brackets: `[folderName]`. For example, `[id]` or `[slug]`. Dynamic Segments are passed as the `params` prop to [`layout`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout), [`page`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page), [`route`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers), and [`generateMetadata`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#generatemetadata-function) functions.



[Example use cases](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#example)

+ [Catch-all Segments](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments): **catch-all** subsequent segments







## 3.3 :bangbang:Parallel routes - slot @foldername

https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes



<span style="color:yellow">一句话总结: 感觉是为了能把一个page作为prop传递给一个layout, 而不影响url的structure, 从而使多个page可以simultaneously or conditioanlly rendered on the same layout (感觉这点在vanilla react里很容易实现) </span>

> 之前我们都是一个url对应一条tree path (从root到page所处在component tree的底部的leaf node 所形成的path), 这个tree path定义了页面的渲染结构, 但是这条tree path是只能一直往下不能在一个节点同时分叉的, 即一个url对应的页面只能渲染处在component tree某个level的一个page
>
> 而引入parallel routes之后, 就相当于tree path可以在一个节点同时分叉了, 这样就可以在一个layout中simultaneously or conditionally 渲染多个page 
>
> 再次理解 `parallel route`的含义, 其实parallel就是说 tree path 可以同时拥有多个分支呗, 之前的route 其实都是sequential route, 对应component tree不能有多于1个分支





<span style="color:yellow">Parallel Routing allows you to <u>simultaneously</u> or <u>conditionally</u> render one or more pages <u>in the same layout</u>.</span>

:gem: see 2 use cases at [2 use cases of parallel route]( https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes)

+ simultaneous rendering of one or more pages
  + and you can even define independent loading and error state for each page
  + :gem: [Modals e.g.](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#modals)
+ conditionally rendering of a page
  + :gem: [Conditional Routes e.g.](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#conditional-routes)





Parallel routes are created using named **`slots`**. <span style="color:yellow">Slots are defined with the `@folder` convention, and are passed to the same-level layout as props.</span> 

> note: <span style="color:red">`Slots` are *not* route segments and *do not affect the URL structure*.</span> The file path `/@team/members` would be accessible at `/members`.

see example at [Convention](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#convention)



below

+ team & analytics are pages but parallelly rendered in the same layout, note `@team` & `@analytics` folder don't affect URL structure

<img src="./src_md/parallel-route1.png" style="zoom:50%;" />



### :question: handling unmatched route - default.tsx

[Unmatched Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#unmatched-routes)

没看太懂



[`useSelectedLayoutSegment(s)`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#useselectedlayoutsegments))

 this hook allows you to read the active route segment within that slot.

也没看懂



## 3.4:question: Intercepting routes (..)

https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/intercepting-routes



<span style="color:yellow">一句话总结: 没完全理解到底是什么意思</span>>



Intercepting routes allows you to load a route from another part of your application within the current layout. 

This routing paradigm can be useful when you want to display the content of a route without the user switching to a different context.

+ use case: create modal



:gem: [modal demo using parallel and intercepting route](https://github.com/vercel-labs/nextgram?tab=readme-ov-file)





### convention

Intercepting routes can be defined with the `(..)` convention, which is similar to relative path convention `../` but for segments.

You can use:

- `(.)` to match segments on the **same level**
- `(..)` to match segments **one level above**
- `(..)(..)` to match segments **two levels above**
- `(...)` to match segments from the **root** `app` directory

:bangbang: but note - the `(..)` convention is based on *route segments*, not the file-system (e.g. a slot is not considered as a segment).



For example, you can intercept the `photo` segment from within the `feed` segment by creating a `(..)photo` directory.

<img src="./src_md/intercepting-route1.png" style="zoom:50%;" />





# 4. Next reqeust & response

## 4.1 :question: Route handlers - route.ts

https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers

<span style="color: yellow">一句话: Route Handlers allow you to create custom request handlers for a given route using the Web [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request) and [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Response) APIs.</span>



> **Good to know**: Route Handlers are only available inside the `app` directory. They are the equivalent of [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) inside the `pages` directory meaning you **do not** need to use API Routes and Route Handlers together.





### conventions

Route Handlers are defined in a [`route.js|ts` file](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route) inside the `app` directory:

```ts
// app/items/route.ts: 
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic' // defaults to auto
export async function GET(request: Request) {}
```

Route Handlers can be nested inside the `app` directory, similar to `page.js` and `layout.js`. But there **cannot** be a `route.js` file at the same route segment level as `page.js`.
