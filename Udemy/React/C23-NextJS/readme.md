# Intro

a fullstack framework for react.js / a react framework for production

+ Next.js solves common problems and make it easier to build react



## key features

Server-side rendering

+ next.js allows automatic page pre-rendering before sending html to the client
  +  great for SEO and inital load
+ blending client-side and server-side.
  +  Fecth data on the server and render finished pages

file-based routing

+ react router needs code to define routing logics, 
+ but Nest.js gets rid of that code-based routing: it defines pages and routes with files and folders instead of code
  + Less code, less work, more understandable

build fullstack app

+ easily add backend (server-side) code to your Next/React apps
+ CRUD data, authentication etc. can be added to your react projects
