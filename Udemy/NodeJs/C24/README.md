REST APIs: decouping Frontend and Backend

+ what is REST APIs
+ why use/build REST APIs
+ Core REST Concepts & Principles
+ First REST API!



not every Frontend requires HTML pages!

+ mobile apps, they don't use HTML to build frontend
+ single page web apps, like udemy (react.js属于这类)
+ sometime we just want data don't want any HTML, e.g. service APIs such as Google Map APIs 

So a different kind of response is needed!  REST: Representational State Transfer

+ transfer data iinstead of User Interfaces

说白了就是一个url path 对应一个callback function for business logic
