## What is Express.js



Express.js is a back-end web application framework for building *<u>RESTful APIs</u>* with Node.js. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. [It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressjs)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressjs). Express.js works on top of Node.js web server functionality to simplify its APIs and add helpful new features. It makes it easier to organize your applicationâ€™s functionality with middleware and routing. [It adds helpful utilities to Node.js HTTP objects and facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTTP objects](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/express-js/)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/express-js/).
