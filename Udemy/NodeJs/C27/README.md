Real-Time Web Services with WebSockets

- pushing data from server to client



# Intro

In previous section (Http):

client send request to server, then server handle the request and send response back to client



But what if something changes on the serer and we want to inform a client?

+ e.g. a chat app. 

solution: WebSocket, which is built on top of http, allowing server to actively push data to client

:bangbang: Http and WebSocket can co-exist in one NodeJS app!
