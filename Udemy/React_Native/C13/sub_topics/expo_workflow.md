Expo offers two main workflows: the Managed workflow and the Bare workflow.

1. **Managed Workflow**: In this setup, Expo handles a lot of the complexities for you. You don't need to touch native code or manage platform-specific build configurations. Most of your development can be done in JavaScript/TypeScript, and you can test your app easily using the Expo Go app. However, there are limitations because you can only use the libraries and modules that Expo supports out of the box.

2. **Bare Workflow**: The Bare workflow is closer to a regular React Native setup, but with some of the benefits of the Expo tools. Here's a breakdown:
   - **Flexibility**: You have full access to the native code (iOS and Android). This means you can add any native modules or do any custom native integrations you want.
   
   - **Use of Expo Modules**: Even though you're closer to plain React Native, <u>you can still make use of individual Expo modules (like `expo-camera`, `expo-location`, etc.)</u> by installing and configuring them separately. This is facilitated by the `expo install` command which ensures compatible module versions are used.
   
   - **Build & Deployment**: Unlike the managed workflow, where Expo handles the build process for you, in the bare workflow you'll be responsible for building your app binaries (.apk for Android and .ipa for iOS). You'll use tools like Xcode and Android Studio or command-line tools like `gradle` and `xcodebuild`.
   
   - **Development Environment**: While in the managed workflow you primarily use the Expo Go app for development, in the bare workflow you'll develop using native simulators/emulators or real devices, similar to a regular React Native setup.
   
   - **Initiating a Bare Workflow**: You can initiate a project in the bare workflow directly using `expo init` and choosing the bare template. Alternatively, you can also "eject" from the managed workflow to the bare workflow if you start facing limitations in the managed setup.
   
   - **Upgrades & Maintenance**: In the bare workflow, you're responsible for upgrading React Native, managing native modules, and handling any potential compatibility issues between libraries.

The Bare workflow is beneficial for projects that need a level of flexibility beyond what the managed workflow offers, especially when specific native modules or deeper platform integrations are required. It provides a balance between the ease of use that Expo offers and the flexibility of pure React Native.
