Inversion of Control (IoC):  The approach of outsourcing the construction and management of objects.

:pencil: [IoC concepts](./sub_md/IoC.md)



Traditional way:

<img src="./Src_md/IoC1.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

Solution of Spring: 应用工厂模式

+ based on configuration, generate corresponding object

<img src="./Src_md/IoC2.png" style="zoom:50%;" />



:star: `Spring Container`: working as object factory (一个大的工厂模式应用, 即充当上图中的Object Factory), it has two functionalities

+ Create and manage objects *(**Inversion of Control**)* 
+ Inject object dependencies *(**Dependency Injection**)*.  下面讲

**Configuring Spring Container**: 3 ways

+ XML configuration file *(legacy)*, not gonna focus on this in this course
+ Java Annotations *(modern)* 
+ Java Source Code *(modern)*



# 2. Dependency injection

32 Defining Dependency Injection - Overview

The dependency inversion principle:  The client delegates the responsibility of providing its dependencies to another object



:bangbang: We will cover the two recommended types of injection :

+ `Constructor Injection`
  + Use this when you have <u>required dependencies</u>
  + Generally recommended by the spring.io development team as first choice
+ `Setter Injection`
  + Use this when you have <u>optional dependencies</u>
  + If dependency is not provided, your app can provide reasonable default logic



:star: `@Autowired`

For dependency injection, Spring can use autowiring, Spring will look for a class that matches
+ *matches by type*: class or interface

Spring will inject it automatically ... hence it is autowired

:bangbang: 为啥JR说尽量别用@Autowiring呢



## 2.1 Constructor Injection

33-36

实现如下的sequence 的 demo

![](./Src_md/dependency_injection1.png)



go to https://start.spring.io 

+ 别选snapshot version of Spring Boot
+ Dependencies选择:
  + Spring Boot DevTools
  + Spring Web



---

Code:

```java
public interface Coach {
    String getDailyWorkOut();
}
```

create candidate class for injection

+ use `@Component` to mark it as a Bean. 

  + A Spring Bean is just a regular Java class that is managed by Spring

  + `@Component` also makes the bean available for dependency injection

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component  // mark the class as a Spring bean, the class will become candidates for dependency injection (Spring will scan through the @Component class to check for candidates)
public class CricketCoach implements Coach{
    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkOut() {
        return "Practice fast bowling for 15 min!!!!!";
    }
}
```



Create a constructor in your class for injections 

+ here we use `@Autowired` to tell Spring to inject a dependency
  + 注意`@Autowired` is used to decorate method or constructor, not a class or field (you should avoid using it on a field)


```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class DemoController {
    // define a private field for dependency
    private Coach myCoach;
  
    // define a constructor for dependency injection
    @Autowired  // @Autowired annotation tells Spring to inject a dependency (create a Coach Obj and inject into this constructor)
    public DemoController(Coach theCoach){
        myCoach = theCoach;
    }

    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")		// API 
    public String getDailyWorkout(){
        return myCoach.getDailyWorkOut();
    }

}
```

re-run application, check out at localhost:8080/dailyworkout



P35最后提了下如何设置intellij来使得Spring DevTools中的auto build project生效



:bangbang: IDE warning - no usages

it says: no usage of CricketCoach class, but we do use it in getDailyWorkout()!

This is because Spring Framework is dynamic, IDE may not be able to determine if a given class/method is used at runtime. So simply ignore "no usage" warning 

<img src="./Src_md/problem1.png" style="zoom:50%;" />



### Constructor injection - Behind the scene

37

Spring Framework do below work for you

```java
Coach theCoach = new CricketCoach();		// instantiate the dependency
DemoController demoController = new DemoController(theCoach);	// inject the dependecny via constructor
```



This is too simple, but why do we need Spring to do this?

Spring is targeted for enterprise, real-time/real-world applications. It provides features such as 

+ Database access and Transactions
+ REST APIs and Web MVC
+ Security
+ etc..



## 2.2 Component scanning

38-40

Spring will scan your Java classes for special annotations ( e.g. @Component, etc ...)

Automatically register the beans in the Spring container



`@SpringBootApplication` is composed of the following annotations:

| Annotation               | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| @EnableAutoConfiguration | Enable Spring Boot's auto-configuration support              |
| @ComponentScan           | Enables component scanning of current pacakge, also recursively scans sub-packages <br/> (所以默认main SpringBoot application 所在的路径下的所有package都会被scan) |
| @Configuration           | able to register extra beans with @Bean or import other configuration classes |



Behind the scene: 

+ it creates applications context and register all beans 
+ it starts the embedded server Tomcat etc...

```java
package com.luv2code.springcoredemo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

// @SpringBootApplication enable:
// auto configuration (@EnableAutoConfiguration),
// Component scanning (@ComponentScan),
// Additional configuration (@Configuration)
@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringcoredemoApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(SpringcoredemoApplication.class, args);
	}

}
```



:bangbang: `@SpringBootApplication` 默认只扫描自己所在的路径及其子路径, 但其实也可以指定component scanning的范围

```java
package com.luv2code.springcoredemo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication(
	scanBasePackages={
    "com.luv2code.springcoredemo",	// 自己所在的路径
    "com.luv2code.util",
    "org.acme.cart",
    "edu.cmu.srs"
  }
)
public class SpringcoredemoApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(SpringcoredemoApplication.class, args);
	}

}
```



---

code: component scanning

39-40

Just demonstrate `@SpringBootApplication`的默认component scanning 与指定路径的component scanning





## 2.3 Setter Injection

42,43

Inject dependencies by calling setter method on your class



Spring do the work behind the scene:

```java
Coach theCoach = new CricketCoach();
DemoController demoController = new DemoController();
demoController.setCoach(theCoach);
```



Just put a setter method to inject coach using `@Autowired` in the DemoController

```java
@RestController
public class DemoController {
    // define a private field for dependency
    private Coach myCoach;

    @Autowired
    public void setMyCoach(Coach theCoach){     // note method name here is not important
        myCoach = theCoach;
    }
    
    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getDailyWorkout(){
        return myCoach.getDailyWorkOut();
    }

}
```

and everything runs just like in constructor injection demo



## 2.4 Field injection

43

note **field injection** is not recommendated by spring.io development team

+ in early days, field injection was popular on spring projects. But in recent years, it has fallen out of favor

+ In general, it makes the code harder to unit test. Some old project might use it



```java
@RestController
public class DemoController {
    // field injection, use @Autowired directly on the field
  	@Autowired
    private Coach myCoach;
    
    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getDailyWorkout(){
        return myCoach.getDailyWorkOut();
    }

}
```



## 2.5 Others 



### @Qualifiers

45-47

Annotation autowiring and qualifiers



:bangbang: if we have multiple implementations of interface Coach, how does `@Autowired` know which one should be instantiateed and injected?

+ Intellij 甚至会提醒你需不需要加`@Qualifier`

```java
public interface Coach {
  ...
}

public class CricketCoach implements Coach{
  ...
}
public class BaseballCoach implements Coach{
  ...
}
public class TrackCoach implements Coach{
  ...
}
public class TennisCoach implements Coach{
  ...
}
```

:star: Solution: be specific using `@Qualifier`

+ specify the bean id: cricketCoach
  + same name as the class name, except the first character in lower-case

```java
@RestController
public class DemoController {
    // define a private field for dependency
    private Coach myCoach;
  
    // define a constructor for dependency injection
    @Autowired  // @Autowired annotation tells Spring to inject a dependency (create a Coach Obj and inject into this constructor)
    public DemoController(@Qualifier("cricketCoach") Coach theCoach){
        myCoach = theCoach;
    }

    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")		// API 
    public String getDailyWorkout(){
        return myCoach.getDailyWorkOut();
    }

}
```



:gem: 04-qualifiers



:bangbang: 用了@Qualifier, polymorphism不就成了摆设了吗?



### @Primary 

47-48

@Primary, alternative to @Qualifier

+ if an implementation is marked with @Primary,  then that implementation will be choosen for dependency injection by firstly  if you don't specify which implementation should be injected 



:bangbang: When using @Primary, we can have <u>only one</u> for multiple implementations

+ if you mark multiple implementations with @Primary, problems arise

When Mixing @Primary & @Qualifier

+ @Qualifier has higher priority





```java
@Component
@Primary
public class TrackCoach implements  Coach{
    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkOut() {
        return "TrackCoach: run a hard 5k!";
    }
}
```



```java
@RestController
public class DemoController {
    // define a private field for dependency
    private Coach myCoach;
    
    @Autowired
    public DemoController(Coach myCoach) {      // TrackCoach is marked with @Primary
        this.myCoach = myCoach;
    }

    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getDailyWorkout(){
        return myCoach.getDailyWorkOut();
    }

}
```



### @Lazy 

49-51

<u>By default</u>, when your application starts, all beans are initialized 

+ it scans through @Component, etc... Then, spring will create an instance of each and make them availble



```java
    public BaseballCoach() {
        System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }
```

Terminal output when start application: 

```terminal
In constructor: BaseballCoach
In constructor: CricketCoach
In constructor: TennisCoach
In constructor: TrackCoach
In constructor: DemoController
```



Instead of creating all beans up front, we can also specify lazy initialization

+ A Bean will only be initialized in the following cases:

  + it is needed for dependency injection
  + or it is explicitly requested (e.g. a user send a HTTP request)

+ Just add `@Lazy` to a given class

  + also we have global configuration for lazy initialization

    ```properties
    spring.main.lazy-initialization=true	// in application.properties
    ```



Pros

+ only create objects as needed
+ May help with faster startup time if you have large number of components

Cons

+ if you have web related components like @RestController, it will not be created untill requested
+ Need to make sure you have enough memory for all beans once created
+ May not discover configuration issues until too late





# 3. :moon: Bean 

## 3.1 Bean scope

53-54

Scope refers to the lifecycle of a bean

+ how long does the bean live?
+ how many instances are created?
+ How is the bean shared?

:bangbang: default scope is singleton

+ Spring Container creates only one instance of the bean, by default
+ It is cached in memory
+ All dependency injections for the bean will be reference the SAME bean



:gem: e.g.1 by default all beans' scope is 'Singleton'

```java
@RestController
public class DemoController {
    // define a private field for dependency
    private Coach myCoach;
    private Coach anotherCoach;

    @Autowired
    public DemoController(@Qualifier("cricketCoach") Coach myCoach,
                          @Qualifier("cricketCoach") Coach anotherCoach) {      // TrackCoach is marked with @Primary
        System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
        this.myCoach = myCoach;
        this.anotherCoach = anotherCoach;
    }

    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getDailyWorkout(){
        return myCoach.getDailyWorkOut();
    }

    @GetMapping("/check")
    public String check(){
        return "Comparing beans: myCoach == anotherCoach, " +  (myCoach == anotherCoach);
    }

}
```

check out at localhost:8080

```terminal
Comparing beans: myCoach == anotherCoach, true
```



Also, we can explicitly specify Bean Scope

| Scope          | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Singleton      | Create a single shared instance of the bean. **Default scope**. |
| Prototype      | Opposed to Singleton. Create a new bean instance for each container request. |
| Request        | Scope to an HTTP web request. <u>Only used for web pages</u> |
| Session        | Scoped to an HTTP web session. <u>Only used for web apps</u> |
| Global-session | Scope to a global HTTP web session. <u>Only used for web apps</u> |



:gem: e.g.2 specify Scope of CricketCoach to 'prototype'

```java
@Component  // mark the class as a Spring bean, the class will become candidates for dependency injection
@Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
public class CricketCoach implements Coach{

    public CricketCoach() {
        System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkOut() {
        return "CricketCoach: Practice fast bowling for 15 min now --" ;
    }
}

// DemoContoller 和e.g.1 中一样
```

checkout at  localhost:8080

```terminal
Comparing beans: myCoach == anotherCoach, false
```



## 3.2 Bean Lifecycle methods

Bean Lifecycle

Container started => Bean instantiated => dependency injected => internal Spring Processing => ***<u>Your Custom Init Method</u>*** (now Bean is ready for Use),   if Container is shutdown => *<u>**Your custom Destroy method**</u>* => stop 



+ Custom Bean Init Method during bean initialization => `@PostConstruct`
  + calling custom business logic methods
  + setting up handles to  resources (db, sockets, file etc)
+ Custom Destroy Method during bean destruction => `@PreDestroy`
  + Calling custom business logic method
  + Clean up handles to resources (db, sockets, files etc)



```java
@Component  // mark the class as a Spring bean, the class will become candidates for dependency injection
@Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_SINGLETON)
public class CricketCoach implements Coach{

    public CricketCoach() {
        System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    // define our init method
    @PostConstruct
    public void doMyStartupStuff(){
        System.out.println("In doMyStartupStuff(): " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    // define our destroy method
    @PreDestroy
    public void doMyCleanupStuff(){
        System.out.println("In doMyCleanupStuff(): " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }
    
    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkOut() {
        return "CricketCoach: Practice fast bowling for 15 min now --" ;
    }
}


@RestController
public class DemoController {
    // define a private field for dependency
    private Coach myCoach;

    @Autowired
    public DemoController(@Qualifier("cricketCoach") Coach myCoach) {      // TrackCoach is marked with @Primary
        System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
        this.myCoach = myCoach;
    }

    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getDailyWorkout(){
        return myCoach.getDailyWorkOut();
    }
    
}
```

In terminal, you will see our `@PostConstruct` and `@PrevDestroy` method runs successfully!

```terminal
In constructor: BaseballCoach
In constructor: CricketCoach
In doMyStartupStuff(): CricketCoach
In constructor: TennisCoach
In constructor: TrackCoach
In constructor: DemoController
2023-08-05T22:02:22.353+10:00  INFO 69146 --- [  restartedMain] o.s.b.d.a.OptionalLiveReloadServer       : LiveReload server is running on port 35729

```





:bangbang: Special Note about Prototype Scope

There are 2 subtle points you need to be aware of with "prototype" scoped beans.

+ **For `prototype` scoped beans, Spring does not call the destroy method. Gasp!**

  **In contrast to the other scopes, Spring does not manage the complete lifecycle of a prototype bean\****: the container instantiates, configures, and otherwise assembles a prototype object, and hands it to the client, with no further record of that prototype instance.* *Thus, although initialization lifecycle callback methods are called on all objects regardless of scope,* ***in the case of prototypes, configured destruction lifecycle callbacks are not called\****. The client code must clean up prototype-scoped objects and release expensive resources that the prototype bean(s) are holding.*

+ `Prototype` beans are **<u>lazy by default</u>**. There is no need to use the @Lazy annotation for prototype scopes beans.





## 3.3 Java Config Bean: @Bean

57-59



Use case for @Bean: Make an existing 3rd party class available to Spring framework.

+ but you may not have access to the soruce code of that 3rd party class
+ However, you would like to use the 3rd party class as a Spring Bean

e.g. Our project want to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to store documents. We want to use *AWS S3 client* as a Spring bean in our app.  Note AWS S3 client code is part of AWS SDK, so we cannot modify the AWS SDK source code by adding @Component => use @Bean for AWS S3 client, so that AWS S3 client now becomes a Spring Bean and we can inject it into other services of our application.



:gem: demo

Config class

+ 将bean id 和具体的bean bound together

```java
@Configuration
public class SportConfig {
  
    @Bean("aquatic")             // specify bean id
    public Coach swimCoach(){    // the bean id defaults to the method name!
        return new SwimCoach();
    }

}
```

SwimCoach class is used to simulate a 3rd party class 

+ note we didn't add any Spring Annotation to it

```java
// not using @Component
public class SwimCoach implements Coach{

    public SwimCoach() {
        System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkOut() {
        return "SwimCoach: Swim 1000 meters as a warm up";
    }
}
```

DemoController 

+ 注入在Config class中指定的bean 

```java
@RestController
public class DemoController {
    // define a private field for dependency
    private Coach myCoach;

    @Autowired
    public DemoController(@Qualifier("aquatic") Coach myCoach) {      // TrackCoach is marked with @Primary
        System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
        this.myCoach = myCoach;
    }

    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getDailyWorkout(){
        return myCoach.getDailyWorkOut();
    }

}
```
