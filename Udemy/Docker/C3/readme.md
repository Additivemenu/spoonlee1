dockerfile

A `Dockerfile` is a script that contains a set of instructions to define how a Docker container should be built. It provides a repeatable way to create Docker images, which can then be used to run containers. Each instruction in the Dockerfile adds a new layer to the image, allowing for efficient and fine-grained control over how the image is built.
