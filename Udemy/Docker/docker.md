# Intro 

why use Docker

 



## what is Docker

+ image: single file that has all dependencies & configs  requried to run a program
+ Container: instance of an image, runs a program





behind the scenes of running 

```sh
docker run hello-world
```

+ docker server will firstly try to seek local image 'hello-world', if not find, it will try to seek one from Docker Hub (a remote repository)



## :bangbang: what really is container?

P10

+ operating system basics
  + kernel
  + linux-exclusive feature
    + namspacing: isolating resources per process
    + control groups: limit amount of resources used per resources
