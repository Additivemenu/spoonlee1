# 1. Centralized workflow

The simplest collaborative workflow is to have everyone work on the master branch. Work for tiny team.

But problems arise when team size and project size grows

+ lots of time spent resolving conflicts and merging code, especially when team size scales up
+ no one can work on anything without disturbing the main codebase.
  + how do you try adding something radically different in?
  + How do you experiment?
    + The only way to collaborate on a feature together with another teammate is to push incomplete code to master. Other teammates now have broken codes
