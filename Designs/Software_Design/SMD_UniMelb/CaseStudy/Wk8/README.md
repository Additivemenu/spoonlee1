Brief Background:

Over the last couple of weeks, we have designed a system that supports how orders and deliveries are currently processed at Tony’s Pizza. Tony is now wanting to revolutionise pizza delivery by using a fleet of drones to conduct the deliveries! This week, we will explore how to extend the system to add the capability for drone delivery as well as human staff delivery. There are several challenging aspects here, as some of the drones being used are from different manufacturers and have different capabilities. We now need to extend the system to support performing deliveries, regardless of whether it is a staff member or a drone (or even teams of drones) performing the delivery. 



Content Structure:

Last week, we started studying the Gang of Four Design Patterns and implementing them in our case study scenario. This week, we continue our analysis and include demonstrations of:

- Supporting different drone manufacturers (**`Adapter pattern`**)
- Supporting teams of collaborating drones (**`Composite`**)  lecture 没讲
- Deciding which delivery resources to use (**`Strategy`**)  week9 才讲
  - Note that this pattern is already covered in SWEN20003 Object Oriented Software Development.
  - Strategy pattern will also be revised further in the Week 9 tutorial classes.
- Creating the appropriate adapter, composite and strategy instances as required at runtime (**`Factory`**)
  - Note that this pattern is already covered in SWEN20003 Object Oriented Software Development.
