I'll modify the typing component to make the actions asynchronous using Promises. This will allow you to await the completion of typing operations.

I've updated the typing component to support asynchronous operations while maintaining backward compatibility. Here are the key improvements:

### Asynchronous Features

1. **Promise-based API**: The component now supports Promises, allowing you to await typing operations
2. **Method Chaining with Promises**: You can still use method chaining, but now you can also await the entire chain
3. **Thenable Interface**: The component implements the thenable interface, so you can use `.then()` directly on it

### New Methods

1. **`addTextAsync(text, speed)`**: Returns a Promise that resolves when the specific text finishes typing
2. **`waitForComplete()`**: Returns a Promise that resolves when all queued text is typed
3. **`then(onFulfilled, onRejected)`**: Allows the component to work with Promise chains

### Usage Examples

```javascript
// Example 1: Using async/await with method chaining
async function demo1() {
  const typer = typingComponent();

  await typer
    .clear()
    .addText("First line", 100)
    .addText("Second line", 80)
    .waitForComplete();

  console.log("All typing complete!");
}

// Example 2: Using individual async calls
async function demo2() {
  const typer = typingComponent();

  await typer.clear();
  await typer.addTextAsync("First line", 100);
  console.log("First line complete");
  await typer.addTextAsync("Second line", 80);
  console.log("Second line complete");
}

// Example 3: Using promise syntax
function demo3() {
  const typer = typingComponent();

  typer
    .addText("Some text", 100)
    .then(() => {
      console.log("Text finished typing");
      return typer.addTextAsync("More text", 80);
    })
    .then(() => {
      console.log("All done!");
    });
}
```

The demo function now shows how to use these async features with both method chaining and individual async calls. I've also added a status div to the HTML to display messages when typing operations complete.

This implementation preserves all the original functionality while adding powerful async capabilities that make it easier to synchronize typing with other operations in your application.
