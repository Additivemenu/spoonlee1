Django would be the 4th webframe with which I get in touch, learn it by making analogues with SpringBoot, Express.js, Nest.js




what is Django

+ Django follows the MVT design pattern (Model View Template).  -> still the concept of server side rendering
  - Model - The data you want to present, usually data from a database.
    - In Django, the data is delivered as an Object Relational Mapping (ORM), which is a technique designed to make it easier to work with databases. Similar to Spring Data JPA
  - View - A request handler that returns the relevant template and content - based on the request from the user.
  - Template - A text file (like an HTML file) containing the layout of the web page, with logic on how to display the data.
