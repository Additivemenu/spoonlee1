mainly to learn mongoDB and web socket (socket io)



his code is not really elegant and readble, practice to rebuild the app in your own way

+ Not using any UI lib
+ make the code more elegant and readable
+ use typescript
+ use S3 to upload image
+ use AWS to deploy app



# Key Takeaways

some vscode extensions

+ code spell checker



Server

---

+ Mongoose & MongoDB
  + Schema
  + Model
  + populate
  + query...

+ User sign up & authentication using JWT token
  + `protect` middleware to authenticate a user login

+ :gem: use morgon for logging to help debug
+ :star: 写server api pattern: 边写边validate user input or a db operation result



Postman

---

+ set and save environment variables
+ Authentication token



Client

---

+ React Router V5, 
  + `useHistory` is replaced by other hooks in V6 
  + :bangbang: React Router should be outside of context provider when wrapping `<App />`

+ use of Chakra UI lib
  + Modal
  + Toast for input feedback
  + Menu
+ set proxy in package.json for CORS. we can also config CORS at server 
+ upload image to cloudiary, then MongoDB store pic url
  + S3 should also be able to do this!

+ :bangbang: Authentication & authorization (logged-in user can only see his data)
  + done by set HTTP header when sending axios request
+ :bangbang: manage app-wide states (these states spans across a wide range of components in app) in Context API
  + logged-in user's dynamic info (state)
    + localStorage

  + selectedChats
  + chats that logged-in user get involved in
  + Notifications of logged-in user received

+ :star: handler inovling http request code pattern
  + check input, then do business
  + set boolean state for visual feedback whether async operation is done or not
