#### Brief Background:

Melbourne-based pizza chef Tony Collins has had a lot of success with his pizza restaurant and is now planning to scale his business into a national pizza chain ‘Tony’s Pizza’. He has recruited a team of software engineers to develop a system that will eventually encompass all facets of the business, at each restaurant location. 

The system will be built incrementally, and we will be exploring the requirements of this system through software models and design principles throughout the semester. 



#### Aims:

This case study aims to help you consolidate concepts from the lecture. More specifically, this material will provide you with a more concrete example of how can we apply the concepts or techniques learnt from the lecture to the problem. The content in each week will also help you to better prepare for your own exercises in the workshop. It is highly recommended to check the content before the workshop.

#### Content Structure:

In each week, there will be new content for this case study, which correspond to the lecture content and workshop exercises. The content includes the description of the problem or requirements for the system; the solutions to address the problems, and the demonstration video of how the solution is created.
