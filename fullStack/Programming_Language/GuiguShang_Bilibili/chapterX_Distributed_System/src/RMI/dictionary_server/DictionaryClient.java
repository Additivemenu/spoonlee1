 * does RMI also encapsulate multi-thread?
 * <p>
 * chatGPT: Yes, RMI (Remote Method Invocation) inherently supports multi-threading.
 * When multiple clients make simultaneous calls to the RMI server, RMI creates
 * separate threads for each incoming request. This allows multiple clients to
 * interact with the server concurrently, and the server can process these requests in parallel.
 * <p>
 * In the dictionary server example, we switched from using a HashMap to a ConcurrentHashMap,
 * which ensures that the dictionary can be safely accessed and modified by multiple threads
 * simultaneously without the need for explicit synchronization. Thanks to this change, the
 * dictionary server can handle concurrent requests from multiple clients without any issues.
 * <p>
 * However, if you were using a data structure that wasn't thread-safe, you'd need to add
 * explicit synchronization to ensure the correct behavior when accessed concurrently. In
 * such cases, you could use the synchronized keyword or more advanced synchronization constructs
 * like Lock and ReadWriteLock
