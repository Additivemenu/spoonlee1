CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment, which are key practices in modern software development. Here's a brief overview of each:

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: This is a development practice where developers integrate code changes into a shared repository frequently, typically several times a day. Each integration is verified by an automated build and automated tests to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. The main goal of CI is to provide rapid feedback so that if a defect is introduced into the code base, it can be identified and corrected as soon as possible.

2. **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: This extends the concept of CI, automating the software delivery process further to enable easy and confident deployments into production at any time. Continuous Delivery ensures that the software can be reliably released at any moment. It involves automating the entire software release process, with the only manual step being the actual 'push' to production.

3. **Continuous Deployment (also CD)**: Sometimes CD refers to Continuous Deployment, which is a step beyond Continuous Delivery. Here, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. There's no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change from being deployed to production.

CI/CD is fundamental to a modern DevOps approach and cloud-native software development, helping teams to be more efficient, delivering better quality software with fewer bugs, and releasing it more frequently and reliably.
