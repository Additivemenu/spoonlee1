## HTTP header

HTTP request headers and response headers serve different roles in the HTTP transaction. The request headers are sent by the client to the server to <u>provide context about the request</u>, whereas the response headers are sent by the server to the client to <u>provide context about the response</u>.



### HTTP Request Headers

These are used by clients (such as web browsers or API clients) when making a request to the server. They contain information about the client's preferences, the type of content that can be accepted, authentication information, and more. Here are some of the purposes:

1. **Content Negotiation**: Through headers like `Accept`, `Accept-Language`, and `Accept-Encoding`, the client can tell the server what type of content it can process, which language is preferred, and what encodings it understands.

2. **Client Information**: Headers such as `User-Agent` provide information about the client software (like browser type and version), which can be used by the server for logging or to return different content for different client types.

3. **Session Management**: Cookies are sent to the server via `Cookie` headers and are used for maintaining user sessions.

4. **Conditions**: Headers like `If-Modified-Since` allow the client to make conditional requests. For instance, the client can request a resource only if it has been modified since the last time it was fetched.

5. **Authentication**: Headers such as `Authorization` carry authentication credentials to access protected resources.

6. **Control**: Headers like `Cache-Control` instruct the server on the client's caching preferences.



### HTTP Response Headers

When the server responds to a client's request, it sends response headers to provide metadata about the response. These headers inform the client about the server's action in response to the request and how to handle the response content. Their purposes include:

1. **Content Information**: Headers like `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` describe the media type and size of the response body.

2. **Location**: The `Location` header is used to redirect the client to a different URL.

3. **Caching**: Headers such as `Cache-Control` and `ETag` provide caching instructions to the client, which can be used to reduce load times and bandwidth usage.

4. **Control**: Headers like `Connection` control options such as whether to keep the network connection open for further exchanges.

5. **Cookies**: The `Set-Cookie` header sends cookies from the server to the client to manage state or session data.

6. **Security**: Security-related headers like `Strict-Transport-Security` or `Content-Security-Policy` instruct the browser on security policies.

7. **Server Information**: The `Server` header contains information about the server software.



### Key Differences

- **Direction**: Request headers are sent from the client to the server, setting the context for the request. Response headers are sent from the server to the client, providing information about the response.
- **Purpose**: Request headers are more about conveying client preferences and request specifications, while response headers are about server information, content specifications, and instructions for handling the response.
- **Context**: Request headers often include details necessary for the server to correctly understand and fulfill the request (like credentials, accepted response formats, etc.). Response headers are focused on describing the served content and providing any necessary instructions for the client to correctly process the response.



The distinction is essentially based on the direction of the message: request headers are part of an HTTP request sent from the client to the server, while response headers are part of an HTTP response from the server back to the client. <u>Each set of headers provides the necessary context for the other party to correctly process the HTTP message.</u>





## Axios response

When you make a request using Axios, a popular JavaScript HTTP client, the response object you receive contains several fields with detailed information about the response. Here's an overview of the typical fields contained in an Axios response object:

1. **data**: This is probably the most frequently accessed field. It contains the body of the response. The format of this data depends on the response type and how Axios is configured (it could be JSON, an array of bytes, a string, etc.).
2. **status**: This field holds the HTTP status code of the response (e.g., 200 for a successful request, 404 for not found, etc.).
3. **statusText**: A string representation of the HTTP status code, providing a human-readable status message (e.g., 'OK', 'Not Found', 'Internal Server Error').
4. **headers**: This field contains the headers sent back by the server. Headers provide additional context about the response, such as content type, content length, server information, and more.
5. **config**: This includes the configuration object that the request was made with. It contains all the settings and parameters used to make the request, such as the URL, HTTP method, headers sent, timeout settings, etc.
6. **request**: This is the request object that generated the response. It can be useful for debugging and provides insight into the actual XMLHttpRequest or HTTP request that was made.
7. **Axios-specific fields**: Axios may include additional fields for internal use or for providing extended functionality.

It's important to note that when handling responses in Axios, especially in the context of asynchronous operations like promises or async/await, you need to correctly manage and interpret these fields to effectively utilize the response data and handle errors or specific response scenarios.



## JWT token

JWT, or JSON Web Token, is a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

JWTs are used in various scenarios, such as:

1. **Authentication**: After a user logs in, a JWT can be issued, which can be used for subsequent requests to authenticate the user. It's a common method in Single Sign-On (SSO) as it allows the user to be authenticated by different services and applications without logging in multiple times.

2. **Information Exchange**: JWTs are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are and the contents haven't been tampered with.



A JWT typically consists of three parts:

- **Header**: The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

- **Payload**: The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.

- **Signature**: To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

JWTs are a popular choice in modern web applications for their simplicity, ease of use, and scalability in handling authentication and authorization processes.
